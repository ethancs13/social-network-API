## Description

This app allows you to use a noSQL database to provide a place to create thoughts. People can react to those thoughts, and add other users to their friend lists. All of this was done though the use of the `mongoose`, `express`, and `node.js`. The backend routes handle the `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` routes. The video shows off all of the routes being tested in `Insomnia`.
